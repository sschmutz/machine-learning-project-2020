## Report and self-contained `MATALAB` code with data
This folder within the Git repository contains everything which will be handed in for grading.  
It consists of the written report and the code and data used to get from data to result.

### Document structure

```bash
.
+-- README.md
+-- data
|   +-- train.csv
|   +-- test.csv
|   +-- stop_words_german.csv
+-- document_term_matrix.m
+-- cross_validation.m
+-- train.m
+-- test.m
+-- report.mlx
```

### Execute `MATLAB` code

*Make sure the current folder is set to the one this README.md document is located and the workspace is cleared (`clear all; close all; clc`).*
